  Notes
  
  
  * DATA, UI (etc) labels map loosely to M, V, C (etc).  Tasks.swift todo list emphasizes features, design, etc., not very code-specific
  
  
  ✧ denotes features that may not necessarily be a good idea to implement (eg should User be able to defer *all* their upcoming tasks at once?)
