  Notes
  
  
  ⁌o⁍ denotes bugfixes
  
  
  ✧ denotes features that may not necessarily be a good idea to implement (eg should user be able to defer *all* their upcoming tasks at once?)
  
  
  * Data, UI, VCs (etc) labels map loosely to MVC. (This Task List emphasizes features, design, etc.: not very code-specific)
