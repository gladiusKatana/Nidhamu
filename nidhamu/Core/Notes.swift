 * my DATA & UI labels are often loose proxies for the M & V of MVC, respectively. (Why this naming?  Mostly since, in Notes.swift, I want a categorization class for the project itself, and the code itself, not just the app)
 
 
 ✫ programming is always fun, but 'fun' means 'really fun' and 'FUN' means 'REALLY fun'
 
 
 ✧ denotes features that may not necessarily be a good idea to implement (eg, should Users be able to defer *all* their remaining tasks at once?)  Interesting questions.
